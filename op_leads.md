# Operational Leads Proposal

## Problem

The remaining gap between the board and on-the-ground operations is still wide enough that:

* It's difficult for guilds to make small, necessary purchases.
* Volunteers often know the right decision but are unsure whether they’re empowered to make it.
* Some operational decisions (including unpopular ones) aren't getting made.

## Purpose

**Empowering Volunteers & Guild Members to make the MINT run on a daily basis.**

The Operational Leads would:

* Be authorized to make decisions to support day-to-day operations.
* Be able to make operational purchases & reimbursements.
* Provide a point of oversight and coordination between guilds, volunteers, and the board.

## Responsibilities

* Provide access to funds for operational expenses
    * Make purchases or approve reimbursements for day-to-day needs, within predefined budgets and policies.
    * Act as first-line oversight to ensure spending stays responsible and documented.

* Oversee Internal Policy and Committee Coordination
    * Approve policies developed by volunteer groups and guilds—especially those that affect multiple areas.
    * Provide the kind of "leadership sign-off" that feels necessary without needing board-level involvement.

* Make Tactical Decisions
    * When no one knows what to do.
    * When no one agrees on what to do.
    * When something needs to be done.

* Maintain Situational Awareness
    * Stay informed about what's happening across the organization.
    * Watch for patterns or emerging problems before they grow.
    * Empowered to jump in where needed.


## Structure

Team Size: 3 Operational Leads. This provides a healthy balance of consensus-building, flexibility, and continuity. We'll need to develop a shared internal understanding of when a decision can be made individually, collaboratively, or needs to be elevated.

Operational Leads are nominated by current leads, and appointed (or removed) by the board.

Work must be **delegated** or we'll die. Making a decision does not mean doing all the work to make it happen.

Plan for turnover & for peoples' availability to wax & wane. Everyone should have the same access to funds, WA, etc.

## Implementation

Capitalize on natural momentum: people already look to me for answers, approval, or input. There are plenty of things I've just been happy to decide on the spot. There are others I've been reluctant to decide or impose because it's not within my official remit. Find others in a similar position.

Tacit approval from Tyler & Stefania to start making operational decisions is a good start, but we'll need some explicit authority eventually.

We recommend that the board:

Officially Create a small leadership group with responsibility for operational spending and responsibility for making day-to-day decisions.
